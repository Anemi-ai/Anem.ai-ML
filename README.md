## Model
This repository contains code and files related to machine learning models for image classification using the MobileNet architecture. The model is drilled on a data set consisting of two classes: Anemic and Normal

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should be organized in the following directory structure:

This is a dataset containing conjunctiva images, consisting of 2 different classes. This dataset is used to train and test convolutional neural network models.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- cv2
- Pandas

## Run : python app.py
