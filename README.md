# Machine Learning - anem.ai "Say Goodbye to Anemia!" ðŸ¤–
This repository contains code and files related to machine learning models for image classification using the MobileNet architecture. The model is drilled on a data set consisting of two classes: Anemic and Normal

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should be organized in the following directory structure:

This is a dataset containing conjunctiva images, consisting of 2 different classes. This dataset is used to train and test convolutional neural network models.
