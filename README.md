## Model
This repository contains code and files related to machine learning models for image classification using the MobileNet architecture. The model is drilled on a data set consisting of two classes: Anemic and Normal

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should be organized in the following directory structure:

This is a dataset containing conjugtiva image, consisting of 2 different classes. This dataset is used to train and test convolutional neural network models.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- cv2

## Run : python app.py
